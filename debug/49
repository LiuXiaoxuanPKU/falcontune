A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Can you upload a model fine tuned with the transformers Python module from HuggingFace back to HuggingFace Hub and make it public? ASSISTANT: Yes, it is possible to upload a fine-tuned model with the Transformers Python module from HuggingFace to the HuggingFace Model Hub and make it public. Here are the general steps to do so:

1. First, you need to create an account on the HuggingFace Model Hub website if you haven't already. You can sign up for free at <https://huggingface.co/join>.
2. Next, you need to save your fine-tuned model in a format that can be uploaded to the Model Hub. The recommended format is a `tar.gz` file containing the PyTorch or TensorFlow checkpoint along with any associated files, such as a tokenizer or configuration file. You can use the `save_pretrained` method provided by the Transformers library to save your model in this format:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Fine-tune a model and save it
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
# fine-tuning code here
model.save_pretrained('./my_finetuned_model')
```
This will save your fine-tuned model in a folder called `my_finetuned_model` with the necessary files inside.

3. Once you have saved your fine-tuned model, you can upload it to the HuggingFace Model Hub using the `transformers-cli` command-line tool. First, you need to install the tool:
```bash
pip install transformers-cli
```
Then, you can run the following command to log in to your Model Hub account:
```bash
transformers-cli login
```
This will prompt you to enter your Model Hub credentials. Once you have logged in, you can upload your model using the `transformers-cli upload` command:
```bash
transformers-cli upload ./my_finetuned_model --model-type <model_type> --model-name <model_name> --push-to-hub
```
Replace `<model_type>` with the type of model you have fine-tuned (e.g., `bert`, `roberta`, `xlnet`, etc.), and `<model_name>` with a unique name for your model on the Model Hub. You can also specify additional options, such as `--use-deepspeed` to enable DeepSpeed support for your model.

4. After the upload is complete, your model will be visible on your Model Hub profile page, and it will be accessible to anyone who wants to use it via its `model_name` or `model_id`.<|>USER: Is there a way to lock it down so only certain people have access to said new fine tuned model that is uploaded? ASSISTANT: Yes, you can restrict access to your fine-tuned model on the HuggingFace Model Hub by creating a private repository and adding specific collaborators who have access to the repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to your HuggingFace profile page, click on "Create New Model" and choose "Create a Private Model."
2. Give your model a name and select the appropriate language and framework.
3. After creating your private repository, go to the repository settings and click on the "Collaborators" tab.
4. Add the usernames or emails of the people you want to grant access to your model. You can specify whether they have read, write or admin access to the repository.
5. Save the changes and notify the collaborators that they have access to your private repository.
6. When you upload your fine-tuned model to the Model Hub, make sure to specify the repository name in the `transformers-cli` command:
```bash
transformers-cli upload ./my_finetuned_model --model-type <model_type> --model-name <model_name> --repository <repository_name> --push-to-hub
```
Replace `<repository_name>` with the name of your private repository on the Model Hub.

7. Your collaborators can now access your fine-tuned model by specifying the repository name and the model name or model ID in their code:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('<username>/<repository_name>/<model_name>')
```
Replace `<username>`, `<repository_name>` and `<model_name>` with the appropriate values. Your collaborators will also need to have a HuggingFace Model Hub account and be added as collaborators to your private repository in order to access your fine-tuned model.<|>
