A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: If I multiply a 1-dimensional array of 100 values with another 1-dimensional array of 100 values, how big will the resulting array be? ASSISTANT: The resulting array will still be a 1-dimensional array with 100 values. When you multiply two arrays element-wise, the result is an array with the same shape as the input arrays. Since both arrays are 1-dimensional arrays of 100 values, the resulting array will also be a 1-dimensional array of 100 values.<|>USER: What is it called to take two 1-dimensional arrays and create a 2-dimensional array of the products? ASSISTANT: The process of taking two 1-dimensional arrays and creating a 2-dimensional array of the products is called the outer product or outer multiplication. The resulting 2-dimensional array is also referred to as the outer product matrix.

In the outer product, each element of one array is multiplied with every element of the other array to create a matrix of size (m, n), where m and n are the lengths of the input arrays. The (i, j) element of the resulting matrix is the product of the i-th element of the first array and the j-th element of the second array.<|>USER: I want to compute an outer product matrix for two input matrices of 100 elements. However, I can only compute outer product matrices for a max of 10 elements at a time. How many times will I have to perform the product to get the full 100 x 100 array ASSISTANT: If you can only compute outer product matrices for a maximum of 10 elements at a time, you will need to perform the product 10 times for each row of the first matrix, and then concatenate the resulting submatrices horizontally to obtain the full 100 x 100 outer product matrix.

Specifically, each submatrix will have dimensions (10 x 100), since you are multiplying a 1-dimensional array of 10 elements with a 1-dimensional array of 100 elements to obtain a 2-dimensional array of size (10 x 100). Therefore, you will need to perform the product 10 times for each row of the first matrix, resulting in 10 submatrices of dimensions (10 x 100).

Finally, you can concatenate these 10 submatrices horizontally to obtain the full 100 x 100 outer product matrix. Therefore, you will need to perform the outer product 10 times for each row of the first matrix, resulting in a total of 100 x 10 = 1000 outer products to obtain the full 100 x 100 outer product matrix.<|>USER: What if both arrays are limited to 10 elements at a time? ASSISTANT: If both arrays are limited to 10 elements at a time, you will need to perform the outer product 10 times for each row of the first array, and then concatenate the resulting submatrices horizontally to obtain a 10x10 block diagonal matrix.

Specifically, each submatrix will have dimensions (10 x 10), since you are multiplying a 1-dimensional array of 10 elements with another 1-dimensional array of 10 elements to obtain a 2-dimensional array of size (10 x 10). Therefore, you will need to perform the product 10 times for each row of the first array, resulting in 10 submatrices of dimensions (10 x 10).

Finally, you can concatenate these 10 submatrices horizontally and vertically to obtain the 10x10 block diagonal matrix. This matrix will have 10 submatrices on its diagonal, each of size (10 x 10), representing the outer product between each pair of 1-dimensional arrays.

Therefore, you will need to perform the outer product 10 times for each row of the first array, resulting in a total of 10 x 10 = 100 outer products to obtain the full 10x10 block diagonal matrix.<|>USER: Write a python script that can take in two 100 1-dimensional arrays and perform the 10x10 outer products and concatenations as you described ASSISTANT: Sure! Here's an example Python script that performs the 10x10 outer product and concatenation for two input 1-dimensional arrays of length 100:
```python
import numpy as np

# Initialize two 1-dimensional arrays of length 100
array1 = np.random.rand(100)
array2 = np.random.rand(100)

# Initialize an empty matrix to hold the block diagonal matrix
block_diag = np.zeros((10, 10))

# Perform the outer product 10 times for each row of array1
for i in range(10):
    # Initialize an empty matrix to hold the submatrix
    submatrix = np.zeros((10, 10))
    for j in range(10):
        # Compute the outer product between the i-th block of array1 and the j-th block of array2
        outer_product = np.outer(array1[i*10:(i+1)*10], array2[j*10:(j+1)*10])
        # Insert the resulting 10x10 matrix into the submatrix
        submatrix[:, j] = np.ravel(outer_product)
    # Insert the resulting submatrix into the block diagonal matrix
    block_diag[i, :] = np.ravel(submatrix)

# Print the resulting block diagonal matrix
print(block_diag)
```
This code first initializes two 1-dimensional arrays of length 100 using `numpy.random.rand()`. It then initializes an empty matrix `block_diag` of size (10, 10) to hold the block diagonal matrix.

The script then uses a nested loop to perform the outer product 10 times for each row of `array1`. The outer product is computed using `numpy.outer()`, and the resulting 10x10 matrix is flattened into a 1-dimensional array using `numpy.ravel()`. The resulting 10x10 matrix is then inserted into a submatrix of size (10, 10), which is itself inserted into the block diagonal matrix.

Finally, the resulting block diagonal matrix is printed using `print()`.<|>
