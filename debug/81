A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: co2508admin@G20940379Blue:~$ su g20940379-2022
Password: 
su: Authentication failure ASSISTANT: The authentication failure could be caused by several factors, such as an incorrect password or user account not properly created. Let's check if the user account was created correctly.

1. First, let's list all the user accounts on the system to see if the account `g20940379-2022` exists:
```perl
sudo getent passwd | grep g20940379-2022
```
If you see an entry for the `g20940379-2022` user, the account exists. If not, you'll need to create the user account again using the following command:
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash g20940379-2022
```
1. Set the password for the `g20940379-2022` user:
```
sudo passwd g20940379-2022
```
Enter the desired password (e.g., "Km2@22") twice when prompted.

1. Now, try switching to the `g20940379-2022` user account again:
```
su g20940379-2022
```
Enter the password you just set when prompted. You should now be able to switch to the `g20940379-2022` user account without authentication failure.<|>USER: why do i get this thing all the time, sudo: unable to resolve host G20940379Blue: Name or service not known ASSISTANT: The error message "sudo: unable to resolve host G20940379Blue: Name or service not known" typically occurs when there is a mismatch between the hostname in `/etc/hostname` and the hostname in the `/etc/hosts` file. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that both files have the correct hostname.

1. Verify the hostname in the `/etc/hostname` file:
```bash
cat /etc/hostname
```
Make sure the hostname is "G20940379Blue".

1. Check the `/etc/hosts` file:
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```
Make sure the second line contains the correct hostname, like this:
```
127.0.1.1       G20940379Blue   kaliBlue
```
1. If you need to make any changes to either file, use `sudo nano` to edit them:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```
and/or
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
1. Save any changes and exit the editor.
2. After making the necessary changes, reboot the system for the changes to take effect:
```
sudo reboot
```
After the system reboots, the error should be resolved, and you should no longer see the "unable to resolve host" message when using `sudo`.<|>USER: task 2, and explanation on why use these commands same as task 1, Task 2 – Performing Initial Reconnaissance

For this task you should use the ‘red team computer’.
Perform an initial reconnaissance against the blue team computer.
1. Identifying the IP addresses of both computers

Provide screenshots identifying the IP addresses of the red computer and blue computer.
Type in the IP addresses in the table below.

Team Computer IP Address
Red Team 
Blue Team 
2. Discovering open ports on the blue team computer.
Provide screen shots of how you identify the open ports on the blue team computer.
Complete the table below which summarises the ports that you have discovered are open.
Describe the commands you have entered.
Port Number Description
 

3. Operating system fingerprinting
Provide screen shots of how you identify the operating system on the blue team computer.
Complete the table below which summarises your findings.

Computer Operating System
Blue team computer 

4. Identify any daemons/services running

Provide screen shots of how you identify which services/daemons are running on the blue team computer.
Complete the table below which summarises your findings.
Service Port Number Description ASSISTANT: Task 2 – Performing Initial Reconnaissance

1. Identifying the IP addresses of both computers:

To identify the IP addresses of both the red and blue team computers, run the following command on each computer:
```css
ip a
```
This command displays the network configuration details, including the IP addresses of the computers. Take screenshots of the output on both computers and fill in the table with the IP addresses.

Explanation: Identifying the IP addresses is crucial for establishing connections between the computers and conducting network reconnaissance.

1. Discovering open ports on the blue team computer:

To discover open ports on the blue team computer, use a tool like Nmap from the red team computer. Run the following command, replacing `BLUE_IP` with the blue team computer's IP address:
```
nmap BLUE_IP
```
Take a screenshot of the output and complete the table with the discovered open ports and their descriptions.

Explanation: Discovering open ports helps identify potential vulnerabilities, services running on the target computer, and entry points for further exploitation or assessment.

1. Operating system fingerprinting:

To perform operating system fingerprinting on the blue team computer, use Nmap's OS detection feature. Run the following command, replacing `BLUE_IP` with the blue team computer's IP address:
```
nmap -O BLUE_IP
```
Take a screenshot of the output and complete the table with the identified operating system.

Explanation: Knowing the operating system of the target computer helps in choosing appropriate tools, techniques, and exploits during an assessment or penetration test.

1. Identify any daemons/services running:

To identify running services or daemons on the blue team computer, use Nmap's version scanning feature. Run the following command, replacing `BLUE_IP` with the blue team computer's IP address:
```
nmap -sV BLUE_IP
```
Take a screenshot of the output and complete the table with the identified services, their port numbers, and descriptions.

Explanation: Identifying running services and daemons provides insight into the target computer's functionality and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited during a penetration test.<|>USER: └─$ nmap -O 192.168.133.128
TCP/IP fingerprinting (for OS scan) requires root privileges.
QUITTING! ASSISTANT: To perform operating system fingerprinting using Nmap with the `-O` flag, you need root privileges. You can run the command with `sudo` to provide the necessary permissions:
```
sudo nmap -O 192.168.133.128
```
Replace `192.168.133.128` with the blue team computer's IP address. After entering your password for sudo, the command should execute successfully, and you will be able to see the fingerprinting results.

Remember to take a screenshot of the output and complete the table with the identified operating system.<|>
