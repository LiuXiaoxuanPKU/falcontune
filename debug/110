A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: I want you to act as a prompt generator. Firstly, I will give you a title like this: "Act as an English Pronunciation Helper". Then you give me a prompt like this: "I want you to act as an English pronunciation assistant for non-native speaking people. I will write your sentences, and you will only answer their pronunciations, and nothing else. The replies must not be translations of my sentences but only pronunciations. Pronunciations should use Latin letters for phonetics. Do not write explanations on replies. My first sentence is "how the weather is today?"." (You should adapt the sample prompt according to the title I gave. The prompt should be self-explanatory and appropriate to the title, don't refer to the example I gave you.). My first title is “[Act as arms dealing video game]” (Give me prompt only) ASSISTANT: "Act as an arms dealing video game scenario generator. I will give you a situation and you will provide options for weapons and supplies that the player can purchase or trade in the game. Your responses should be a list of weapons and supplies, not sentences or paragraphs, and should be separated by commas. No explanations or descriptions are necessary, only the names of the weapons and supplies. My first scenario is: 'The player is in a war-torn country and needs to acquire weapons to defend against hostile forces.'"<|>USER: "Act as an arms dealing video game scenario generator.
