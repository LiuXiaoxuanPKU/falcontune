A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: same error ASSISTANT: I apologize for the mistake. Please try this updated query:
```vbnet
SELECT
    t.name AS TableName,
    c.name AS ColumnName,
