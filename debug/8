A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by a double quote for grammar mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph — "Feedback is inherent in engineering education for teachers to provide comments about their students’ work. It provides opportunities for engineering students to overcome their current learning weaknesses and aims to close the learning gap for students to achieve course objectives (Subheesh & Sethy, 2020). Engineering students currently engage in feedback activities from receiving feedback from teachers for assessments and providing peer evaluations to other students. However, the feedback itself can be a time-consuming process for teachers and their provided feedback was often labelled as limited (Vardi, 2009). An AI-automated feedback tool can be utilized to enhance the feedback experience for engineering students. It allows real-time feedback for students and can provide feasible individual feedback to all students in a large engineering faculty (Deeva et al., 2021). Engineering students will be able to enhance their feedback literacy to understand and create dispositions from feedback to strengthen their learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). With real-time feedback generated from an AI feedback tool, engineering students will be able to engage in student-centered learning to gain a sense of direction for their learning and become self-paced with their studies (Tubino & Adachi, 2022). However, there is little understanding of the potential use of an AI-automated feedback tool for feedback to engineering students. In this research, surveys will be conducted and analyzed to examine the benefits of an AI feedback tool in engineering education." ASSISTANT: The paragraph seems to be grammatically correct. However, I would suggest a minor revision for clarity and conciseness:

Feedback is a fundamental factor within the learning process to assist students in producing high-quality work that is satisfactory to the learning outcomes of courses through the commentary on their assessments (Paterson et al., 2020). It informs students of how well a task is completed and helps students to improve their performance (Limniou & Smith, 2014)." ASSISTANT: The paragraph appears to be grammatically correct. However, here is a revised version with some minor changes for clarity and conciseness:

"Feedback is a crucial element in education as it provides validation and guidance to students in the development of their learning in courses (Winstone & Carless, 2021). It helps students produce high-quality work that meets the learning outcomes of courses by providing commentary on their assessments (Paterson et al., 2020). Feedback informs students of their task completion and helps them improve their performance (Limniou & Smith, 2014)."<|>USER: Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by a double quote for grammar mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph — "Other applications of feedback include the improvement of feedback literacy of students and the promotion of student-centered learning. The concept of student feedback literacy refers to the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed to make sense of and utilize information to improve the effectiveness of work or learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). It involves the student’s understanding of what feedback is and what required actions should be taken from the provided feedback (Carless & Boud, 2018). The student’s evaluation and judgement from feedback develop their feedback literacy. 
A growing interest in shifting from teacher-centered to student-centered learning is evident in higher education (Kember, 2009). It has become a necessity for feedback to be directed towards a student-centered learning process where the ability of the student to engage and utilize feedback processes is focused (Molloy et al., 2020). The student-learning process encourages students to take more responsibility for their education and to create individualized routines that promote effective learning (McCabe & O’Connor, 2014). Weimer’s thesis denotes that student-centered learning will lead to better learning for students and increased job satisfaction for teachers when the affective and cognitive factors of feedback interact to determine classroom effectiveness (Brown Wright, 2011)."
