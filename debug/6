A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Finally, add a column in the result set called "lastPaymentAt" which is the date of the last payment the artisan received ASSISTANT: To add the "lastPaymentAt" column to the result set, you can update the `Payment_Info` CTE to include the date of the last payment for each Artisan. Here's the modified query:
```sql
WITH Onboarding_Info AS (
    -- (same as before)
),
Payment_Info AS (
    SELECT
        ap."ArtisanId",
        SUM(ap."amount") as total_payment_value,
        MAX(ap."paymentDate") as last_payment_at
    FROM
        "ArtisanPayouts" ap
    GROUP BY
        ap."ArtisanId"
),
Expiry_Info AS (
    -- (same as before)
)

SELECT
    p."ArtisanId",
    p.total_payment_value,
    o."Quarter",
    o."onboardingType",
    CASE
        WHEN o."SubscriptionTierId" = 1 THEN 'Free'
        WHEN o."SubscriptionTierId" = 2 THEN 'Premium'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS "SubscriptionTier",
    COALESCE(e."expiry", 0) AS "expiry",
    p.last_payment_at AS "lastPaymentAt"
FROM
    Payment_Info p
JOIN
    Onboarding_Info o ON p."ArtisanId" = o."ArtisanId"
LEFT JOIN
    Expiry_Info e ON p."ArtisanId" = e."ArtisanId";
```
In the `Payment_Info` CTE, we have added the `MAX(ap."paymentDate") as last_payment_at` line to get the date of the last payment for each Artisan. Then, in the final SELECT statement, we include the `p.last_payment_at AS "lastPaymentAt"` to add the "lastPaymentAt" column to the result set.<|>USER: sort the result set by lastPaymentAt ASSISTANT: To sort the result set by "lastPaymentAt", you can add an `ORDER BY` clause at the end of the query. Here's the updated query:
```sql
WITH Onboarding_Info AS (
    -- (same as before)
),
Payment_Info AS (
    -- (same as before)
),
Expiry_Info AS (
    -- (same as before)
)

SELECT
    p."ArtisanId",
    p.total_payment_value,
    o."Quarter",
    o."onboardingType",
    CASE
        WHEN o."SubscriptionTierId" = 1 THEN 'Free'
        WHEN o."SubscriptionTierId" = 2 THEN 'Premium'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS "SubscriptionTier",
    COALESCE(e."expiry", 0) AS "expiry",
    p.last_payment_at AS "lastPaymentAt"
FROM
    Payment_Info p
JOIN
    Onboarding_Info o ON p."ArtisanId" = o."ArtisanId"
LEFT JOIN
    Expiry_Info e ON p."ArtisanId" = e."ArtisanId"
ORDER BY
    p.last_payment_at;
```
This query adds the `ORDER BY p.last_payment_at` clause at the end, which sorts the result set by the "lastPaymentAt" column in ascending order. If you want to sort the result set in descending order, you can use `ORDER BY p.last_payment_at DESC`.<|>USER: Using the ArtisanPayouts table, return the total value of payments across months, starting from the earliest possible month. Format months as "Month Year" (January 2022). Include the number of payments that resulted in total:

e.g.
Month, Value, Number Of Payments
January 2022, 1000000, 15 ASSISTANT: To achieve this, you can use the `to_char()` function to format the payment dates, and then use the `SUM()` and `COUNT()` aggregate functions to calculate the total value and number of payments per month. Here's the query:
```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(ap."paymentDate", 'Month YYYY') AS "Month",
    SUM(ap."amount") AS "Value",
    COUNT(*) AS "NumberOfPayments"
FROM
    "ArtisanPayouts" ap
GROUP BY
    TO_CHAR(ap."paymentDate", 'Month YYYY')
ORDER BY
    MIN(ap."paymentDate");
```
In this query, the `TO_CHAR()` function is used to format the payment dates as "Month Year". The `SUM()` and `COUNT()` aggregate functions are then used to calculate the total value and number of payments for each month, respectively. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by the formatted payment dates, and the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the earliest payment date.<|>USER: For each month, calculate the average payment value ASSISTANT: To calculate the average payment value for each month, you can use the `AVG()` aggregate function. Here's the updated query:
```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(ap."paymentDate", 'Month YYYY') AS "Month",
    AVG(ap."amount") AS "AverageValue"
FROM
    "ArtisanPayouts" ap
GROUP BY
    TO_CHAR(ap."paymentDate", 'Month YYYY')
ORDER BY
    MIN(ap."paymentDate");
```
In this query, the `AVG()` aggregate function calculates the average payment value for each month. The rest of the query remains the same as before, formatting the payment dates as "Month Year" and grouping the results by the formatted payment dates.<|>USER: Round off the average to 2 decimal places ASSISTANT: â€‹<|>
