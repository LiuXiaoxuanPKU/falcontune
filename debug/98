A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: didn't fix it ASSISTANT: I apologize for the confusion. Here's a corrected query that should work for you:
```sql
SELECT t.name AS TableName, c.name AS PrimaryKeyColumn, c1.name AS NoOrCodeColumn
FROM sys.tables t
INNER JOIN sys.columns c ON t.object_id = c.object_id AND c.is_primary_key = 1
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 c1.name
    FROM sys.columns c1 
    WHERE c1.object_id = t.object_id AND (c1.name LIKE '%\_no' ESCAPE '\' OR c1.name LIKE '%\_code' ESCAPE '\')
) c1
WHERE t.is_ms_shipped = 0 -- exclude system tables
AND t.name NOT LIKE 'sys%' -- exclude system tables
AND t.name NOT LIKE 'queue_%' -- exclude service broker tables
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM sys.columns c2
    WHERE c2.object_id = t.object_id AND c2.is_identity = 0 AND c2.is_nullable = 0 AND c2.is_computed = 0
) > 1 -- at least 2 non-nullable columns
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM sys.foreign_keys fk 
    WHERE fk.parent_object_id = t.object_id
) = 0 -- no foreign key relationships
AND t.name NOT LIKE '%[_]%' -- exclude tables whose names contain '_'
AND c1.name IS NOT NULL -- exclude rows where NoOrCodeColumn is NULL
ORDER BY t.name;
```
This query should give you the table name, primary key column name, and the column name that contains `_no` or `_code`. It also excludes tables that have foreign key relationships, tables whose names contain underscores, and tables with less than two non-nullable columns. Additionally, it excludes rows where NoOrCodeColumn is NULL.<|>USER: still having the same problems stop using is\_primary\_key ASSISTANT: I apologize for the confusion. Here is the revised query that should work for you:
```sql
SELECT t.name AS TableName, 
       c.name AS PrimaryKeyColumn, 
       c1.name AS NoOrCodeColumn
FROM sys.tables t
INNER JOIN sys.index_columns ic ON t.object_id = ic.object_id 
INNER JOIN sys.columns c ON t.object_id = c.object_id AND ic.column_id = c.column_id
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 c1.name
    FROM sys.columns c1 
    WHERE c1.object_id = t.object_id AND (c1.name LIKE '%\_no' ESCAPE '\' OR c1.name LIKE '%\_code' ESCAPE '\')
) c1
WHERE t.is_ms_shipped = 0 -- exclude system tables
AND t.name NOT LIKE 'sys%' -- exclude system tables
AND t.name NOT LIKE 'queue_%' -- exclude service broker tables
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM sys.columns c2
    WHERE c2.object_id = t.object_id AND c2.is_identity = 0 AND c2.is_nullable = 0 AND c2.is_computed = 0
) > 1 -- at least 2 non-nullable columns
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM sys.foreign_keys fk 
    WHERE fk.parent_object_id = t.object_id
) = 0 -- no foreign key relationships
AND t.name NOT LIKE '%[_]%' -- exclude tables whose names contain '_'
AND c1.name IS NOT NULL -- exclude tables that don't have a column ending in _no or _code
ORDER BY t.name;
```
This query uses the `sys.index_columns` system view to find the primary key column instead of using `is_primary_key`. Also, I've added an additional condition to exclude tables that don't have a column ending in \_no or \_code.<|>USER: I only want to see distinct table\_name rows but still want to have the two other columns on above query and dont use is\_primary\_key ASSISTANT: Sure, you can modify the query to use a subquery to retrieve the primary key column instead of using the `is_primary_key` column. Here's an example:
```sql
SELECT t.name AS TableName, pkc.name AS PrimaryKeyColumn, 
    no_code.name AS NoOrCodeColumn
FROM sys.tables t
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT c.name AS name
    FROM sys.index_columns ic 
    INNER JOIN sys.columns c ON c.object_id = ic.object_id AND c.column_id = ic.column_id
    WHERE ic.object_id = t.object_id AND ic.index_id = 1
) pkc
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 1 c1.name AS name
    FROM sys.columns c1 
    WHERE c1.object_id = t.object_id AND (c1.name LIKE '%\_no' ESCAPE '\' OR c1.name LIKE '%\_code' ESCAPE '\')
) no_code
WHERE t.is_ms_shipped = 0 -- exclude system tables
AND t.name NOT LIKE 'sys%' -- exclude system tables
AND t.name NOT LIKE 'queue_%' -- exclude service broker tables
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM sys.columns c2
    WHERE c2.object_id = t.object_id AND c2.is_identity = 0 AND c2.is_nullable = 0 AND c2.is_computed = 0
) > 1 -- at least 2 non-nullable columns
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM sys.foreign_keys fk 
    WHERE fk.parent_object_id = t.object_id
) = 0 -- no foreign key relationships
AND t.name NOT LIKE '%[_]%' -- exclude tables whose names contain '_'
AND no_code.name IS NOT NULL -- exclude rows where NoOrCodeColumn is NULL
GROUP BY t.name, pkc.name, no_code.name
ORDER BY t.name;
```
This query will return distinct `TableName` values along with the corresponding primary key column and the first column containing "\_no" or "\_code" in its name. It also excludes any rows where `NoOrCodeColumn` is NULL, groups the results by the three columns, and orders the results by `TableName`.<|>
