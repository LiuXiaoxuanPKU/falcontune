Dear All,

I hope this message finds you all stay safe after the intense rainfall and winds that passed through Auckland overnight. Unfortunately, the area I live in was also affected by the floodwaters. Although my own home was safe, some parts of my neighbourhood were not as lucky, and there are still some roads closed due to the impassable floodwaters. However, I'm relieved to hear that better weather is expected to come later this afternoon.

Thank you, Changzoo, for suggesting new dates for the meeting. The dates you have suggested work well for me. If there's some flexibility, I would prefer to have our meeting take place between 10 am and 2 pm. If that's not possible, I'm willing to make arrangements to meet outside of those hours.

Hi Lynne,

This morning the northbound traffic at Northcote Rd was comig UP the southbound on-ramp, so I had to detour along Akoranga & Esmonde. No other issues.

Finally got to work 30min late.

Today Kristine & John are leaving the marina at Whangaroa and heading towards the Bay of Islands, where they will pick up a third crewman for the final leg to Auckland.

Best regards,
Peter ASSISTANT: Dear Peter,

Thanks for the update! I hope you're doing well now after encountering some issues with the northbound traffic at Northcote Road. I'm glad to hear that you finally arrived at work, even if it was 30 minutes late.

It sounds like Kristine and John are having a great adventure on their journey to the Bay of Islands. I hope everything goes smoothly and they have a great time picking up the third crewman for the final leg to Auckland.

Take care and talk to you soon,
Lynne<|>
